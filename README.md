## Data
### Folder Structure
- Folder "origin" contains originally scanned data of signatures.
- Folder "control" contains data of control group, where volunteers wrote at least twice specified names.
- Folder "experiment" contains data of experimental group, where volunteers wrote specified names on paper, iPad, phone (in hand) and phone (on table).
- Folder "results" contains computing results of all models.
- Folder "models" contains trained neural network models.

## Code
### Folder Structure
Code for analysis is contained in folder "control" and folder "experiment", and that for image process is contained in folder "imageprocess".

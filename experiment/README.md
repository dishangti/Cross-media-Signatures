## Experimental Group
### Folder Structure
- Folder "rect" contains cropped signatures from original data.
- Folder "square" contains squared signatures from folder "rect".
- Folder "bin" contains binarized signatures from folder "square".
- Folder "skel" contains skeletonized signatures from folder "bin".

Volunteers numbered `34, 36` are written with left hand.

Notice that data in folder "square" of number `51, 68, 79, 93, 94, 95, 95, 100` has been abandoned and then renumbered in folder "bin" and "skel".
